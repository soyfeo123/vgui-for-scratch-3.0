VGUI for Scratch 3.0

This is a GUI system for scratch to make making GUI/Menus MUCH easier.

Tired of having to make sprites for each single button in your menu?
Tired of having to program every single clone?

No worries! VGUI's got you covered!

VGUI is a complex, simple to use, UI framework for Scratch.
You can use it to create buttons, and more stuff.

It also includes a slightly modified version of T# included!

To use VGUI, simply use the "create button" and "write" custom blocks!

(The "write" block doesn't actually add a button, it just adds a text! But it can be used as a title if you don't have a logo.)

Oh, and also you can use the ID value and broadcast blocks to create functions when a button is pressed! 

Just do this.
Select any ID (like new_game, load_game or quit!).
Then, it'll send a broadcast or you can modify what the system sends when you/the user presses a button!
